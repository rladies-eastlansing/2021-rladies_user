R-Ladies+ useR! 2021


## Beatriz Milz

I made a presentation about my experience at useR! 2019 and some of the outcomes from it. The presentation is available in [this link](https://beatrizmilz.github.io/slidesR/R-Ladies_and_useR_meetup/). I am a co-organizer of R-Ladies São Paulo since 2018, and I had the opportunity to participate in the event because I received a diversity scholarship, and was my first time participating in an international R conference. It was a life-changing experience!

There were four points that I wanted to emphasize that was special about participating at useR!2019:

- **Learn:** I watched two tutorials and several talks, and was a great opportunity to learn. I also participated at the tidyverse developer day. I had never seen the code of a package before the tidyverse developer day, and in the event, I had the opportunity to collaborate on an issue of the dplyr package. That really meant a lot to me, and it was the first step for me to became an R developer, and not only a user!  
- **Make friends:** I connected with people and made really good friends at the event, and those people are really special to me since then.
- **Share**: In the event, I had the opportunity to present a lightning talk about the activities of R-Ladies in São Paulo (presentation available [here](https://beatrizmilz.github.io/useR2019/#1)). For me as a person that started at R-Ladies being a person that did not like to talk in public, that meant a lot!
- **Network with the R community in Latin America:** Until useR, I did not knew other people from the Latam R Community outside my country (Brazil). I watched [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMR0vye6Kms) from [Laura Ación](https://twitter.com/_lacion_) about the R community development and growth in Latin America, and after that, I talked to her and she helped me to connect with the community :)

There were also some outcomes that were possible because I had the opportunity to participate in the conference:

- **Learning Spanish:** in Latin America, Brazil speaks Portuguese and the other countries speak mainly Spanish. So when I returned to Brazil, I started to learn Spanish to be able to talk with people from the Latam community. Now I'm at the intermediate course, and I still have classes every Saturday afternoon. Now I can communicate at Portunhõl (is a joke about mixturing Portuguese and Spanish!).
- **Latin-R**: [Latin-R](https://latin-r.com/) is an important conference organized by the Latin American R community, but I hadn't heard about the event before useR. I had also the opportunity to participate at Latin-R in 2019, and I am part of the organization committee of 2020 and 2021. 
- **Package Dados:** At useR! 2019, [Riva Quigora](https://twitter.com/rivaquiroga) presented about the package [datos](https://cienciadedatos.github.io/datos/), which provides datasets translated to Spanish. In 2020, Riva contacted me about the possibility of making a sibling package: dados, with datasets translated to Portuguese.  The package [dados](https://cienciadedatos.github.io/dados/) was developed, and 10 people participated in this project so far, mostly R-Ladies! Soon the package will be submitted to CRAN, and so far it has been used in R tutorials, blog posts, and courses in Portuguese.
- **satRday São Paulo:** At useR! 2019, there was also an activity about the event [satRdays](https://satrdays.org/), which are low-cost R conferences, organized by the local communities. I and other people from the community in São Paulo were interested in it, and we organized the event: in November 2019 the first [satRday in São Paulo](https://saopaulo2019.satrdays.org/) happened! 

Now I am in the communications team at useR! 2021, and I hope I can contribute to making an awesome event. I also hope that useR! 2021 can be a life-changing experience for a lot more people, as it was for me!
