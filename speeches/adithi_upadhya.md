Hi everyone! Thank you all so much for inviting me and thanks to all who have joinedtoday. I think I am having a fan girl moment with all the people on the panel today, I have   seen   all   the   work   they   do   in   R   and   the   community. So I am Adithi and I work as a Geospatial Analyst at ILK Labs in Bangalore. I startedmy R journey way back in 2017 and till I joined my work place in 2018, I cluelessabout the R community. So, my colleague mentioned one day that there arecommunities called R Ladies and R cat ladies, I started following them on twitter andthen I attended an event to make your own website by Dorris Scott. I was blownaway by how the whole meet up was smooth and I had my own web page by the endoftwohours.So I thought if it could make me so empowered in just two hours, why not startsomething in a time friendly way. So, in August 2020 a few friends and I started theBangalore, India chapter. And of course, the R-Ladies community is so helpful inevery step in setting it up (thanks to Yanina!), the mentoring on how to make achapter run smoothly or just setting up accounts. More than the chapter running smoothly, it was all the beautiful and amazing RLadies present helped us grow.Since we started recently not many people attend as of now though we do have astrong data base of people who are interested. And fortunately, all the amazing R-people Allison Horst, Maelle Salmon, Janani Ravi and Meenakshi Kushwaha who isgoing to be a keynote in useR! 2021 did events with us. We feel really privileged forall the support and help. Fortunately, our sister chapters help us reach out to morepeople. Thanks again for that. So, my useR! journey is very unconventional onethough - I knew about useR! all along but I could never attend it. And it was a dreamto attend of course. But constraints you know. So, one day Yanina, thanks so much,was looking for volunteers from all time zones and reached out. I was so excited and I jumped into it and said yes, I assist in some of partners and sponsors and programand content work. Everyone is super helpful and are a fantastic team. The way thiswhole conference has evolved to being held at one place and itâ€™s going all globalwith volunteers from almost all different time zones. And the quality of content is socarefully picked and a lot of time and energy is spent on this. And with all this, we aretrying to make it friendly for all time zones and areas of interest. And we hope tomeet everyone there and increase our R friend list! I am super excited to attend myfirst useR! Sitting at your own places we will have a R blast, I am sure!
